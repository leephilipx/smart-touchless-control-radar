## GUI for Gesture Extraction
 - `gui-dip-demo/gesture_extractor_gui.py` is a Python script developed by Philip to automate the process of extracting gesture samples from a continous recording obtained from the GUI tool provided by Acconeer. This fixes the alignment issue faced when recording one sample at a time.
 - The tool saves extracted samples in `.npz` format with the intention of a small file size.  
   To read data from these new files, please use `np.load('filename-000.npz')['sample']`, where *filename* is a placeholder.
 - For ease of running the tool, an alternative Windows executable file `gui-dip-demo/gesture_extractor_gui.exe` is available too.

## GUI for Data Collection (needs fixing)
 - `gui-dip-demo/daq_menu_v1.py` is a Python script developed by Philip and Wai Yeong via *Tkinter* and *Acconeer SDK* to assist in automating the process of recording and saving radar data in IQ format.

 - Sample commands:&nbsp;&nbsp;`python daq_menu_v1.py`,&nbsp;&nbsp;`python daq_menu_v1.py -l`,&nbsp;&nbsp;`python daq_menu_v1.py -p COM3`, `python daq_menu_v1.py -c xb112_config.json`
```
usage: daq_menu_v1.py [-h] [-p P] [-l] [-c C]
