In fact, this is possible to divide your group into 3 sub-groups on hardware, radar signal processing, machine learning to work separately at moment. 
•	Sub-group 1 (1 student): to learn more about the hardware about various parameter settings so as to get clearer images.
How to set parameters to get more points per sweep and how these parameters are related? 
I noted that some data has thousands points per sweep, some hundreds, some only 64 like your provided to me about the hand gestures.
•	Sub-group 2 (2 students):  on radar signal processing to try STFT and the attached another algorithm MFCC (a Pythorn code is also attached);
•	Sub-group 3 (2 students): on machine learning (with PC or Rasberry Pi) using the attached 3 category of radar signature images (100 image for each category). 
Later you can use your own radar signitue images to replace these images. The procedure is same.
