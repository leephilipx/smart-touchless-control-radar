# Acconeer Deep Learning examples

Here you can find selected examples for how you can use Acconeer's radar sensor in combination with deep learning.
Before following any of the examples presented here, we recommend to have a read through the [documentation](https://acconeer-python-exploration.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deep_learning/introduction.html) for our deep learning interface.
There you can find a general overview of the procedure and how to use the different settings presented in the GUI.
Please make sure you have installed the additional packages required via

```
python -m pip install -U --user -r requirements_ml.txt
```
This will install Keras, TensorFlow and Scikit-learn.
Please make sure you installed the correct package versions for Keras and TensorFlow!
You can then start the machine learning GUI with

```
python gui/main.py -ml
```
